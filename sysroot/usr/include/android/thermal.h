/**
 * Provides an estimate of how much thermal headroom the device currently has before
 * hitting severe throttling.
 *
 * Note that this only attempts to track the headroom of slow-moving sensors, such as
 * the skin temperature sensor. This means that there is no benefit to calling this function
 * more frequently than about once per second, and attempted to call significantly
 * more frequently may result in the function returning `NaN`.
 *
 * In addition, in order to be able to provide an accurate forecast, the system does
 * not attempt to forecast until it has multiple temperature samples from which to
 * extrapolate. This should only take a few seconds from the time of the first call,
 * but during this time, no forecasting will occur, and the current headroom will be
 * returned regardless of the value of `forecastSeconds`.
 *
 * The value returned is a non-negative float that represents how much of the thermal envelope
 * is in use (or is forecasted to be in use). A value of 1.0 indicates that the device is
 * (or will be) throttled at {@link #ATHERMAL_STATUS_SEVERE}. Such throttling can affect the
 * CPU, GPU, and other subsystems. Values may exceed 1.0, but there is no implied mapping
 * to specific thermal levels beyond that point. This means that values greater than 1.0
 * may correspond to {@link #ATHERMAL_STATUS_SEVERE}, but may also represent heavier throttling.
 *
 * A value of 0.0 corresponds to a fixed distance from 1.0, but does not correspond to any
 * particular thermal status or temperature. Values on (0.0, 1.0] may be expected to scale
 * linearly with temperature, though temperature changes over time are typically not linear.
 * Negative values will be clamped to 0.0 before returning.
 *
 * Available since API level 31.
 *
 * @param manager The manager instance to use.
 *                Acquired via {@link AThermal_acquireManager}.
 * @param forecastSeconds how many seconds into the future to forecast. Given that device
 *                        conditions may change at any time, forecasts from further in the
 *                        future will likely be less accurate than forecasts in the near future.
 * @return a value greater than equal to 0.0, where 1.0 indicates the SEVERE throttling threshold,
 *         as described above. Returns NaN if the device does not support this functionality or
 *         if this function is called significantly faster than once per second.

 * Gets the thermal headroom thresholds for all available thermal status.
 *
 * A thermal status will only exist in output if the device manufacturer has the
 * corresponding threshold defined for at least one of its slow-moving skin temperature
 * sensors. If it's set, one should also expect to get it from
 * {@link #AThermal_getCurrentThermalStatus} or {@link AThermal_StatusCallback}.
 * <p>
 * The headroom threshold is used to interpret the possible thermal throttling status based on
 * the headroom prediction. For example, if the headroom threshold for
 * {@link ATHERMAL_STATUS_LIGHT} is 0.7, and a headroom prediction in 10s returns 0.75
 * (or `AThermal_getThermalHeadroom(10)=0.75`), one can expect that in 10 seconds the system
 * could be in lightly throttled state if the workload remains the same. The app can consider
 * taking actions according to the nearest throttling status the difference between the headroom and
 * the threshold.
 * <p>
 * For new devices it's guaranteed to have a single sensor, but for older devices with multiple
 * sensors reporting different threshold values, the minimum threshold is taken to be conservative
 * on predictions. Thus, when reading real-time headroom, it's not guaranteed that a real-time value
 * of 0.75 (or `AThermal_getThermalHeadroom(0)`=0.75) exceeding the threshold of 0.7 above
 * will always come with lightly throttled state
 * (or `AThermal_getCurrentThermalStatus()=ATHERMAL_STATUS_LIGHT`) but it can be lower
 * (or `AThermal_getCurrentThermalStatus()=ATHERMAL_STATUS_NONE`).
 * While it's always guaranteed that the device won't be throttled heavier than the unmet
 * threshold's state, so a real-time headroom of 0.75 will never come with
 * {@link #ATHERMAL_STATUS_MODERATE} but always lower, and 0.65 will never come with
 * {@link ATHERMAL_STATUS_LIGHT} but {@link #ATHERMAL_STATUS_NONE}.
 * <p>
 * The returned list of thresholds is cached on first successful query and owned by the thermal
 * manager, which will not change between calls to this function. The caller should only need to
 * free the manager with {@link AThermal_releaseManager}.
 *

 *                will be set to the cached array of thresholds if thermal thresholds are supported
 *                by the system or device, otherwise nullptr or unmodified.
 * @param size non-null output pointer whose value will be set to the size of the threshold array
 *             or 0 if it's not supported.
 * @return 0 on success
 *         EINVAL if outThresholds or size_t is nullptr, or *outThresholds is not nullptr.
